### Part 2 Creative Labs

ðŸ¤– Speculative SciFi Machine

I'm not sure what kind of machine it would be, but this panel would serve the person who would operate it. What I do know is that it depends on a general switch to be operated. It has two engines whose temperature is independently monitored and mapped on the control panel, and this information generates knowledge for the operator.
